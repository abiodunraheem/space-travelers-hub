# Space Travellers Hub

Space travellers is a project that lists information from the space-x Api about the space [rockets](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/rockets) that they have and the [missions](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/missions) that they have already done.


The project is interesting as it allows users to book rockets as well as join a mission that they feel they are interested in. All booked rockets and joined missions can be viewed from the myProfile page.


Enjoy!
